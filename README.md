📘 CS50 Algorithm Projects
📝 Description

This repository contains C programming projects from the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course, focusing on algorithms and data structures.
Projects include Sort, Plurality, and Runoff, designed to practice basic algorithms, voting systems, and problem-solving skills.

🎯 Purpose

To practice:

Algorithm implementation in C (sorting, searching, voting)

Using arrays and structs

Loops and conditional statements

Handling user input and dynamic data

💡 Features
Sort

Sort a list of numbers using implemented algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort)

Input numbers from a file or command line

Output the sorted list

Plurality

Implement a plurality voting system

Handle multiple candidates

Count votes and declare winner(s)

Runoff

Implement an instant-runoff voting system

Handle ranked voting

Eliminate lowest-ranked candidates and recalculate until a winner emerges

🛠️ How to Run

Compile each project using make:

make sort
make plurality
make runoff


Run the compiled program:

./sort input.txt
./plurality candidate1 candidate2 candidate3
./runoff candidate1 candidate2 candidate3
